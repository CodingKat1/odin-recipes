# odin-recipes
In this current project, I will build a simple recipe website. There are several skills I have gained that will be demonstrated in this project. 

One such skill is basic boilerplate HTML formatting. It is formatted to have parent and child elements. The elements are given attributes.
The index.html page has attributes with relative values. On the recipe pages the images are sourced from absolute values.

I adjusted the width of all pictures with the width attribute and included alt text for all images. Was able to make both unordered lists for ingredient grouping and ordered lists for the step procedures.

I used git on the command line to update my git log constantly and provide thorough messages with each git commit.
